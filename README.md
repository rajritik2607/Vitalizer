# Vicara_HealthCareCrisis_VITalizer

This project aims to allow the users of diffrent age groups to self diagnose themselves.Vitaliser is an app created with the aim to help people diagnose their diseases by giving inputs about their symptoms in a simple questionnaire and receiving their health reports. This app will tell the acuteness of the risk your body is at and will guide you to what you next step should be.This app is made with the easiest to understand UI yet has all the features to best diagnose the disease and help the patient take a quick action in case of high risk.After the completion of the hackathon we further plan to extend this project to include more diseases in the diagnoses range and enhance the features for more better user experience.

## Files

There mainly two division of files in this project. They are: the **_iOS App Code_** files and the **_Deep Learning Model Files_**. The Deep Learning Models can be found under the [DL Models Folder](https://github.com/thefitcoder/Vitalizer/tree/main/DL%20Models). The Rest of the app code can be browsed through the repo.

## Running the Application

**This app can only run on an iOS device.** To run the application on Mac, clone this repository through the master branch into the desired folder and start this project on **XCode**. Build the project and then hit the run button.

## Visualising the Deep Learning Models

There are two Deep Learning Models used in this project. One to detect chances of contacting Novel Coronavirus and another to detect chances of heart related health issues. The Covid Model uses a 4-layer ANN Architecture and the Heart Model uses a 5-Layer ANN Architecture. The inputs for both the models are simple day to day questions whose answers are readily available to a user.

The two models can be visualised as follows: -
